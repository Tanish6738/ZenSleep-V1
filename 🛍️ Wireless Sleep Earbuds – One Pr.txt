Why this "Zen Modernism" theme is also exclusive and premium:

Brightness & Openness: It conveys honesty, purity, and a sophisticated, contemporary feel often associated with high-end tech and wellness brands. It feels less "heavy" than dark themes.
Minimalism: Less is more. A clean layout with ample white space communicates confidence in the product and provides a sense of calm and clarity, which is premium.
Font Choices: Gilroy/Montserrat are very popular in modern premium branding because they are clean, legible, and have a refined technological feel.
Subtle Accents: Using muted sage or pale gold instead of bright, bold colors adds a touch of understated luxury and sophistication.
Focus on "Zen" and "Wellness": Elevates the product beyond just "sleep" into a holistic lifestyle improvement, appealing to a premium audience.
"Engineering" and "Precision Crafted": These terms evoke high quality, meticulous design, and superior performance.
Visual Style: High-key lighting, minimalist product shots, and abstract illustrations look expensive and well-thought-out.
This theme offers a distinct, yet equally premium, aesthetic compared to your initial outline.
